This is a simple program that floods piminex.com with requests using randomly generated private keys. 
The site scams users by tricking them into thinking they'll receive free Pi coins, then asks for their private keys.
By overwhelming the scammers with fake keys linked to empty wallets, we make their "job" a bit harderâ€”and their stolen database more useless.
